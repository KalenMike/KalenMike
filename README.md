### Welcome 😀
Hola! Bonjour! Ciao! Nǐ hǎo! Konnichiwa! Hello!

🔭 I’m currently working on confidential project that is set to launch end of January 2021

## 📜 Some History
I started coding at around 12 years old. I was attracting by the hacking movies that were coming out at the time, One day my dad started up a computer sales store and I met one of his employees who got me started with Visual Basics 6. I was already somewhat of a poweruser when it came to Windows XP and VB6 game pretty fast, its not really a complicated language after all. This peaked my interest in C and I bought some books and started coding.

Some years later my interest in hacking peaked again and I started to learn to python, which eventually led to me creating a gui application for the company I was working at. To aid in operations the app connected to the company CRM and download pending tasks via the REST API, the data was then reformated to make for easier organisation and finally all tasks could be displayed on google maps. Unfortunately my hard drive crashed after a bike trip and I lost the code.

After deciding to leave my corporate job in London and make a trip into Europe I ended up coding a sales management app for the company that hired me. It was an events based business and the app served to keep track of all purchases and the movement of funds. I coded it in PHP and MySql, the php was all new to me but I was familiar with MySql as I had used it in several projects before.

These days I work freelance and build anything from basic WordPress websites, to more complex Single Page or Progressive Web Apps, to mobile applications.
